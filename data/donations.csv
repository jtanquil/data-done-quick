25.00,It has been incredible watching GDQ grow year over year. And even as a viewer  I feel like a part of it. Because weâre all connected by our shared passion of video games  speedrunning  and doing good. This couldâve just been a speedrunning event. It could have just been a fundraising event. But itâs both  and that makes it so much more. <3,(Anonymous),07/01/2018 06:49:34 +0000,477895

5.00,"As I said earlier  here is the other donation I would make during the Final Fantasy VI run. I tried to donate earlier  but it seems PayPal messed up and it didn't quite process it right. I'll be sure to handle that in the morning  so for now  here's another attempt coming from me. Runnerguy2489's Ocarina of Time Bingo run was really fun to see  and hats off to NicroVeda's Odyssey run. Unfortunately  we reach the last hour or so of Summer Games Done Quick 2018. But as the saying goes  ""all good things must come to an end "" even if it's only temporary. That being said  the $5 goes to Wrexsoul  even if it's closed. It's not much coming from me  but I'd say it's enough. By the way  if this donation goes through  it'll be my second donation ever to GDQ  wheras the last one was my first. So  here's a shoutout to everyone who made this run a Glitchless 100%  as well as making the incentives happen. I heard some amazing singing and loved every second of the Suplex against the Phantom Train. I'm also giving a shoutout to my high school's athletic director  who is currently trying to suplex cancer. I'll be supporting you all the way! With that in mind  there is one request I'd like to give to the chat  audience  and whoever else so we can end this run with the hypest of HYYYPE! Once the final battle with Kefka comes along  and it'll be time to land the final attacks on him  can we chant  ""BEAT THAT CLOWN! BEAT THAT CLOWN!"" if that's alright? With that in mind  good night  and good luck.",Steve a.k.a TempestMask1000,07/01/2018 06:47:00 +0000,477636

25.00,"I remember running into GDQ the first time after seeing a bunch of people watching FFIX on Twitch the first time. I was so confused.. who's ""SpikeVegeta""? And what's a ""Puwexil""?Five years later  I've seen it all: blindfolded Punch-Out  Super Metroid races  and ""WOOONDERSHOT"". My closet is full of shirts from the Yetee. Thank you GDQ runners and staff for bringing this experience to my life! Congrats on a great event and I wish you all good luck on future events! P.S. Speaking of AGDQ 2013  Puwexil  your shirt looks awfully familiar.",Cluckerino,07/01/2018 06:37:53 +0000,476353

50.00,Hey guys  tired greetings from Germany. It's 8 am right now and I'm still watching this awesome FF VI Run (sitting on my couch now for over 16 hours since Kirbys Dream Land). This SGDQ is the second  I'm able to watch and it's absolutely awesome. Thanks to all the runners  the GDQ-Crew  the people in the chat and all around the globe on their screens for making and supporting this remarkable charity event. Two days ago I got the message  I will lose my job til end of july. I was absolutely down and sad  but the SGDQ cheered me up again with their unique people  humour and positive attitude. So take this 50 Dollars from me  all of you deserve it. And now go for this 2 million dollars! By the way: is your couch still comfy after 6 hours FF6? Mine is ;-),Drying Bloodline,07/01/2018 06:25:56 +0000,474938

5.00,thank you to everyone involved in these events. i never imagined that playing video games could generate so much money for charity. GDQ and similar events are meaningful and bring life changing help to those truly in need. i'm a caregiver for two family members with severe mental health issues and i've always told myself that i couldn't donate because i needed to save the money for my family. however  i know that even though my family situation is dire  it is manageable and even though i don't have a lot of money  i can make a small donation to this great cause. please keep up the great work  you are all a much needed positive force in the world.,blamerob,07/01/2018 06:23:48 +0000,474745

I'm so glad my favorite Final Fantasy has this epic slot! And all the lore the couch has sketched out shows just how much control they have over this game.

10.00,"I've been watching all week and there is this ad on twitch for that movie with Dwayne ""the Rock"" Johnson where he is climbing the side of a building with duct tape on his hands. And I keep thinking about how little sense that makes and why he would make the decision to risk his life on a wad of duct tape in each fist. I understand that it is a work of fiction and that the suspension of disbelief is important to enjoying most entertainment media  but still  it's hard to accept.  I guess what I'm trying to say is  thank you all for doing what you do  keep doing it  Good luck on the final runs of SGDQ!",Babyshifter,07/01/2018 04:07:32 +0000,473442

25.00,*AHEM* Minecart passage is NOT mode 7. Mode 7 can only scale a single contiguous background layer. Minecart has ALL KINDS of overlapping going on. As far as I can discern  minecart passage is actually a zillion sprites being juggled at once  with various scales of premade art being swapped on the fly. So yes  still pushing SNES to its limit (1 zillion is basically all 128 SNES sprites)  but NOT mode 7.,ProfNES,07/01/2018 02:51:21 +0000,472857

It was one of the reasons we got to know each other as we do now!

133.70,A fond memory of FFVI was during one of my runs  I was grinding outside of Zozo. My 4 year old sister at the time really wanted to help  so I let her run around and do battles for me and press and continuously press the red button. I was high enough level there was no worry of dying. To this day my sister who is now 27 remembers that memory.,BahamutX99,07/01/2018 02:37:47 +0000,472779

5.00,"As mentioned previously  here is the donation I said I would try to get in during this Final Fantasy VI run. I don't know if my first donation was read before  but I will assume it was. However  I didn't mention that it was my first ever donation to GDQ! Here's my second  which is a shoutout to my high school's athletic director  wishing him the best of health as he tries to suplex cancer. I have to say  though  SGDQ kept the good times going with Runnerguy2489's Ocarina Bingo run  and hats off to NicroVeda with the Odyssey run as well! But  as the saying goes  ""all good things must come to an end "" even if only temporary. What better than to cap it all off with Final Fantasy? Oops  that was another hat pun.

50.00,Puwexil  I can honestly say watching your runs four years ago with Essentiafour it opened my eyes in how to play a game without borders and push our abilities beyond what we were thought impossible to overcome. I can't wait to see what we can do in the future by banding together like this for such noble causes to help MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res or the Prevent Cancer Foundation with the power of the human spirit and proving our parents wrong that playing video games would not amount to anything worthwhile.  P.S.

50.00,And for the last run  here's my last donation for this SGDQ. Already starting getting hyped for AGDQ next year  and starting to plan to take a week off. It's 2 am here  I had around 4h of sleep last night  and my whole week's sleeping schedule was torn to pieces. Best thing is that I have another event coming up at the end of next week  so I won't have much time to recover. Nevertheless  once again thanks to everyone for this awesome week. I sometimes wish it could last longer  but I have to get my productivity at work back at its usual state from time to time. See you all next time. Also  money goes toward fighting Ifrit and Shiva. We need to get every extra second of GDQ we can.,Seika,07/01/2018 00:02:11 +0000,471305

25.00,Hello everyone. This SGDQ was amazing and i'm happy that i could watch as much as i could. It's always a huge pleasure and an even more awesome time when a GDQ is live. A whole week of a broken sleep schedule and tons of caffeine. That's how i like my GDQ <3P.S.: I'll donate another 25$ when the lovely boys  Spikevegeta and Trihex would do a fusion after Oddysey. Ofc DragonBall Stile. As a little tribute to the good old days <3,Kafuno,06/30/2018 22:55:52 +0000,470721

10.00,Hey  everyone! Tempest here. I often watch Games Done Quick runs on YouTube  and when I first discovered GDQ  I was impressed with the amount of people attending it. I thought of watching as many SGDQ runs live as I could this year  but things got busy  so I couldnât find much time for that. Even so  Iâm glad Iâm able to have watched the Super Mario Maker race. Iâm especially glad to see Carl Sagan finally getting in on the action. Five dollars of this donation goes to performing during the opera  and the rest tosuplexing the train in Final Fantasy  because heck yeah! This donation is being made in honor of my great-aunt and my high schoolâs former principal. They were two amazing people we lost to cancer  but I often remember them in good spirits. I might donate later during Final Fantasy VI  but for now  good luck to the remaining runners! Oh  and Poo  Carl  remember this: the levels may be tough on you  but revenge is best served Moleâd.

50.00,So much love to everyone who makes this incredible week of games possible. In this house  SGDQ and AGDQ are events worthy of losing sleep and copious gaming. And having spent arguably way too much time playing FFVI in my formative years  my bucks are going toward seeing it blazed through completely in all its glory. With the world being ripped apart by an imbalance of forces that malevolent  corrupt leaders vie to wield  we can count on a stalwart band of Returners to speedrun through this World of Ruin and help make it a beautiful place for all its citizens  from Narshe to Thamasa. Thanks for all that you do. Kupo!,(Anonymous),06/30/2018 18:07:46 +0000,467419

His whole community is great and a save haven. During my chemothreapy I went through not too long ago he helped me to stay positive as well as all the other amazing people. #MoofleZ,Arthrex,06/30/2018 10:36:13 +0000,465061

13.37,"When speed running the Star wars games  I always found that the odds of successfully surviving the speed runs are 3720 to 1! <4th wall Note to Announcer> This is where the runner should say: ""Never tell me the odds!"" </4th wall Note to announcer>  Of course  most gamers would be crazy to follow us (speedrunners). You guys are so good you must have done these runs training with Obi Wan to become Speedrunner Jedi Masters with that blindfold helmet that Luke wore while practicing! Maybe in the future there can be an incentive to have the runners ""use the force"" just a Luke did and play the games blindfolded with a black welding helmet as I would TOTALLY love to see how a true Padawan trains to become a speed run Jedi! Better yet - can you do any Star Wars game Speed Run in less than 12 parsecs (minutes)?  But I digress - I dedicate this donation to Carrie Fisher (may she rest in peace) and I wish you all good luck running all Star Wars games.

2235.00,Two months ago I lost my 28 year old boyfriend due to a previously unknown heart condition. We met 10 years ago at Dreamhack (the huge LAN party in Sweden) and gaming was always a big part of our relationship. Everything from trading PokÃ©mon in bed to knife-killing each other in Battlefield.For the last few years we always watched GDQ while we had the chance. We never missed the PokÃ©mon run no matter what time of day (or nightâ¦) it was played.One month ago I somehow managed to graduate med school and Iâve worked as a doctor for two weeks now.The combination of all this made it an easy choice to donate money in his memory to Doctors without borders through SGDQ.This is from friends  family and kind strangers. Rest in peace my beloved,In memory of Patrik âTazzâ,06/30/2018 05:23:04 +0000,464362

It showcases some of the most beautifully inhuman ways a piece of software can be broken within the constraints of it's own code. It's never really the same when you aren't here.

Although I'll be missing most of the rest of the marathon  you can bet I'll be watching the VODs for months to come. If everybody in chat donated five dollars  we'd be able to smash the Mario Odyssy run  which will be a sight to behold indeed.

25.00,#MIBA I had to donate during a run of probably the most important game of my life. As a kid  I fell in love with Wind Waker in 1st grade when I got the game for Christmas. Playing the game made me decide that I wanted to go to school to make video games. That dream fueled me all throughout school until I was able to find Ferris State University and the Digital Animation and Game Design program there. By going to school there  I was able to meet my boyfriend  form a dance company  and meet my current group of friends  and one of those friends is why Iâm sitting here in back couch at SGDQ right now. Basically  I have Wind Waker to thank for everything great that has happened in my life. Thank you so very much to Linkus7 for running such a wonderful game at such a wonderful event.,Back Couch Charmander,06/30/2018 01:45:34 +0000,462922

5.00,Kingdom Hearts must be my favourite game series of all time. Funny thing how Days  the game about nobodies  made me feel the most of them all (I'm a sappy guy  what can I say?). The speedruns are always fun to watch  and I'm looking forward to Biz's 1.5+2.5+2.8 Level 1 Superboss run. That'll happen  right? (optional read part here)A signal boost for the games  There's a complete KH collection available on PS4  which includes KH3. Get that instead of all the HD collections separate.,icer107,06/29/2018 22:27:55 +0000,461292

10.00,Well  better late than never! I didn't realize one of my favorite charities was up until I had spent all of my money on Sims 4 packs  ha ha ha! XD So here is my miniscule donation going towards Bizkit047's Sephiroth fight. I have enjoyed watching his Youtube videos and hope he runs Kingdom Hearts 3 when it comes out in 2019 and sets the standard time for it as the first runner. ;) Anyways  I know this comment will probably not be read  but I have enjoyed the Shantae race a lot. I have Pirate's Curse on my Switch and have had a hard time getting 100% on it  but these two runners made it look EASY! I also enjoyed the Majora's Mask 3D run because I was too cowardly to buy it for my 3DS even though Mask was my N64 Zelda. I extend my sympathy to teddyras for failing both of his runs. You were a brave man to try to show off a run of Enter the Gungeon  the perfect storm of pure evil in gaming  but you sure broken the heart of Lady Luck to have gotten her so furious at you and cursed you with such failure runs like that. I believe you are capable of speedrunning Enter the Gungeon  I can't even play that nightmare of a game casually! :) (At least you got to the final boss!) I hope this donation gets through and good luck to the remaining runners and see you all in AGDQ 2019!,DragonQuestFan238,06/29/2018 05:37:45 +0000,458251

If I can ding it for one thing its that it should have been called ""Neuro-Shock "" as its the closest spiritual successor to the classic System Shock 2  much more-so than even its derivatives like BioShock. If you enjoy FPSs with metroidvania-like exploration and RPG elements  you will not regret picking it up!

40.04,Aaah.... Finally donating for the first time. Better late than never right ? I have watched Games Done Quick for several years and now that I have a job  I definitely needed to join in the donations! I was just waiting for a good game to donate during (that's not good grammar  is it?) and Paper Mario is just the one. Favorite game of all time there. While I would love to get a say in whether or not to bring Luigi  that FX attack is too important to leave alone! Now just pretend I remember which sound this one makes and imitate it please.^^,FdRstar,06/28/2018 18:10:55 +0000,453456

25.00,Long time viewer  first time donator. I've been watching AGDQ/SGQD for years since the last time Oracle of Seasons was last runned here but I've been waiting since then to be this my first donation ever. This was the Zelda that got me hooked up into the series just because of the fact that I got stuck in D3 because when I was younger I couldn't figure that you could jump and skip the Button to get to the Mid-Boss until I got smarter. After that I got stuck with D4  so I skipped it and did D5 like Mghtymth did when he was younger as well. So  thank you for submitting  running this game and maybe someday I'll speedrun this myself!

10.00,The legend of Zelda was my first Zelda game years before I knew even it's name. We used to play at my friends home because she had an NES and there was this game with the green guy and a sword  then I got older and forgot about it. A couple of years after Ocarina of Time hooked me up onto the series I finally got an NES and Legend of Zelda. It felt so familiar! And little by little I remembered those times when I was a kid of around 6 and we played a lot of games on the NES. Zelda will always be the game with the oldest memories for me.Good luck to the runners and drop those bombs where they cause the most damage!,Raigen,06/28/2018 15:31:35 +0000,453041

The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly  but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal. [beep] A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound. [ding] Remember to run in a straight line  and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound  your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark  get ready  start.,Mr_Rippe,06/28/2018 05:18:40 +0000,451834

I also still have fond memories of the Jumper games  where the deadliest edges of Celeste seem to have been forged. Best of luck to the racers!

Double take 3 times.5. Pelvic thrust to your left  then back to your right.6. Stop on your right foot as you come back to your right after the pelvic thrust. (Don't forget it!)7. ""Bring it around town"" by spinning your torso in a circle around the air.8. Jump around for about 6 seconds.9.

10.00,I never did finished Skyward Sword  mainly because I didn't like the main vilain  but also because I didn't had enough time to play at the time it released and never went back to this game. But this run makes me want to restart it and complete it this time. I might run it over the next week(s). Also  not the first donation of this SGDQ (and definitly not the last)  but I had to try my luck at those standee. They're so cute <3 Keep the awesome runs coming  and thanks to all at SGDQ (staff  runners  announcers...) for what you do.

Skyward Sword is one of my favorite Zelda games and am enjoying this run for the next 5 hours. That green rupee cutscene gave me a wonderful idea. Iâll donate more if you collect the following  5& for first blue rupee or a whopping 20$ for a red rupee if you run into one in the run. Good luck gymnast and may the goddesses bless your run.,GameBroJeremy,06/27/2018 07:50:33 +0000,447637

30.00,One of my two favorites time of the year again. I can't afford to donate much  like every time  but what little I can  I do. And what better time to do so than during Metroid? The whole serie is awesome  and I really liked Samus Return as I never managed to play the original. After playing all the recent ones  Metroid II is just unplayable. Even though I didn't cleared it as fast  I was still proud of my 10h 100% blind run. Also  Metroid Prime 4 hype! And so Fusion can exist in the timeline  the animals must be saved. Thanks everyone for providing hours of entertainment for my long days at work.,Seika,06/27/2018 02:27:18 +0000,446477

30.00,Always love to see the Metroid block at GDQ. Iâve grown up with the series including endless hours on camping trips trying to beat Metroid 2 and Super Metroid being my reason for getting a SNES. Samus is one of the greatest protagonists of all time and itâs always a blast to see her at her best with these speedrunners at the controls. GL to the racers and keep up the wonderful work on this marathon! :D,Jessie Lockhart,06/27/2018 01:33:28 +0000,446274

5.00,It's such a perfect arrangement: Super Metroid  one of the franchise's greatest entries  being played right after not only two games chronologically set right before it  but also the one that returned the series to proper form and undid the damage done to Samus by Other M  a game whose first scene tries to rewrite the events of Super to fit its ludicrous narrative and depiction of Samus.

10.00,My older brother and I love watching SGDQ together every year  but I'm about to leave for basic training in a couple months so this may be one of the last times we can watch together as I travel around for the next couple of years. I wanted to show my love and support for this amazing event. It's given us and so many others an amazing experience and supports an amazing cause.
